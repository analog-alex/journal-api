## How to launch locally

Something like üòÄÔ∏è:
- clone repo
- run `docker-compose up -d mongo`
- fill the `.env` file following the `.env.example`
- launch with `npm start`

Requires **npm** and **docker**. Though it can also use a normal **MongoDB** instance as long as the connection url is valid.
